## GitHub Code of Conduct

**This Code of Conduct applies to all Shell employees, including contractors and third party users, using the GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Shell.**

GitHub is a cloud based service SaaS to manage application development and deployment.

GitHub provides two types of Enterprise products:

1. GitHub Enterprise Cloud - GHEC
2. GitHub Enterprise Server - GHES

At Shell we use **GitHub Enterprise Cloud - GHEC** 

## Accessing the GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Shell safely and securely

Authentication into the Shell GitHub Enterprise organization is via **Two-Factor Authentication (TFA)** – provided by GitHub – and through SSO (PingID).
TFA ensures that, should an unauthorized user obtain a user’s log in credentials (username and password) they are still unable to access the account without also having the GitHub authentication code sent to the users personal phone. They would also need to pass an additional layer of authorization through PINGID.

Shell repositories under the Royal Dutch Shell GitHub organization can only be accessed by the employees and contractors of Shell. **Contractors must sign a confidentiality agreement before working with Shell.** 

Non-Shell developers wishing to access the GitHub service must be sponsored by a Shell custodian. The Shell custodian must raise a [TPA request through ServiceNow](https://shell.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=838d7325db587b80bd27f9231d9619ad), access rights are only provided to people with an identity registered in IMS.

## Your responsibilities as a GitHub Shell Enterprise User

Whilst GitHub allows users to create public repos under their personal account and share it with other GitHub user, we **DO NOT** recommend Royal Dutch Shell GitHub Enterprise members to create public repos with Shell related information. **Any repos which contain Shell information and are set up under a under a personal account and not the Shell Enterprise are a breach in data confidentiality.**

Current organization policies under Royal Dutch Shell GitHub Enterprise will prevent users from creating a public repo, even by accident. If anyone does create a public repo with Shell related information, and who does not have prior permission from Shell Legal Team to contribute to an open source repo, they will receive a formal notification and will need to take corrective action to change the repo visibility to Private or Internal.

## Generally Embargoed Countries (GECs)
